Yo~this is Tomy, a cool Taiwanese guy studying at BYU major in CS.  I'm the owner of TAG, the 1st Taiwanese Fried Ghicken Restaurant in Utah. 

I notice that it misses real Taiwanese food in Provo, Utah. So, I'm going to bring TOP popular Taiwanese food,  Taiwanese Fried Ghicken and Mormon Bubble Milk Tea and other awesome and delicious food, here!

The main reason I do it while studying in the college is because I desire people in U.S have chances to taste & enjoy real Taiwanese delicious food so that they may know Taiwanese culture & how good they are! 

I love TAG so much and I wanna share with as many people as much I can!  I'm really happy to see a lot of people love it too, not only Asian here but also many local people! Hope by doing so will bring a lot of happiness & love around the U.S !  :smile:
