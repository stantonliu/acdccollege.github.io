      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amway.com/about-amway/yagergroup">The Yager Group</a> is an independent Amway approved training provider. Their mentoring and training system has established a proven history of helping indivitual build their own successful business. The Yagers Group’s passion has always been to help people who want to help themselves in a business of their own. By helping people develop a good self-image and a strong self-confidence, the Yager Group has inspired tens of thousands to unleash their full potential.</p>

<p>Amway Global is the number-one direct selling business on the planet, raking in around $9 billion a year. Harvard Business School, which described Amway as “one of the most profitable direct selling companies in the world”, noted that Amway founders Van Andel and DeVos “accomplished their success through the use of an elaborate pyramid-like distribution system in which independent distributors of Amway products received a percentage of the merchandise they sold and also a percentage of the merchandise sold by recruited distributors”. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway">Amway Wiki</a>]</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>I know introduction may not touch your heart, same result as I share with most people. Do you know why? It’s because of lack of knowledge. It’s because it’s easier to reject than to learn. It’s because a new idea clashing with the way they think. “Direct Selling is bad.” “That system does not work.” “It’s impossible to earn that much money.” “That causes too much money and time.” “[Silence with embarrassing smile…]” Some argue instead of asking questions. Some never ask questions. Then I have questions. “How do you know it doesn’t work?” “Have you done the research or tried it by yourslef?” “Or are you allowing other people’s thoughts to block your way to a new life level?” I am always shocked at people who search changes in their lives, but keep doing same things expecting different outcomes and never invest in their greatest asset, their mind. A truly intelligent person welcomes, listens, and talks about new ideas in order to grasp opportunities to achieve his/her goals and dreams.</p>

<p>Have you read one of my favorite books that improve my Financial IQ, “<b>Rich Dad Poor Dad</b>” by Robert Kiyosaki? If not, I sincerely encourage you to read it. It will change the way you think, and maybe change your whole life and your family! If you have, AWESOME! You know how important the knowledge I share with you today!</p>

<p>Most of people are workers, employees. After college, they apply jobs and go to work and work. If they don’t have money, they work harder and pay more taxes. Have you thought about what’s wrong with it? Why should I do it in that way? If I get sick or some reasons that I cannot work, how do I make money? Is there another way that maybe eaiser, or at least I can have choices or freedom? The Rich Dad called it “The Rat Race”, which keeps people inside this trap and work more and harder.</p>

<h4 id="cash-flow-quadrant">Cash Flow Quadrant</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/cash-flow-quadrant.jpg" alt="cash-flow-quadrant">
E is what most people are doing. Some, like lawyers or doctors, are S who earn more and pay more taxes but still in the Rat Race. On the other side, people in the B &amp; I quadrant know how to play the game. They invest on assets instead of liabilities in order to gain passive income. B &amp; I are the places giving them time, money, and financial freedom. The poor and the middle class work for money; the rich have money work for them. These are just few concepts I share from “Rich Dad Poor Dad”. Are you interested now?</p>

<p>The more people I get to know, the more disapointment I have since they have not been taught any solid financial knowledge. There are so many people need help but they don’t know. How sad is that!? If you know me well, you may know I’m a person with a lot of love, sincerity, righteousness, passion about serving and helping people. I know knowledge is power if we know how to use it. I’m planning to have a education business in the future in order to make people’s lives better and change the world. I’m also here to help you.</p>

<p>Today, you get this chance to read this page. I have an opportunity for you to become Individual Business Owner of the Yager Group earning passive income. I know you’re selecting if this is business is right for you. I’m selecting who is going to be my partner as well. If join, you’re going to learn a lot,  changing your mindset the hardest part, reading and listening to entrepreneur talks, and share business ideas with people, in order to get success. Of course, it’s hard. I’m doing it and I know it. However, I also know it’s possible because I’m starting to see results. Do you know why 90% of new businesses fail? It’s because 1.) Time 2.) Money 3.) Knowledge/Skills 4.) Risk. The Yager Group provide an opportunity that cut down those risks for you.</p>

<p>The opportunity button is right below. If you want to join, I won’t accept you right away for I have to make sure if you’re prepared to go for your success. I would love to talk to you first and see what I can help;  if you are not interested, that’s ok. Maybe this does not fit your style. I encourage you to share these financial knowledge with your friends and family and keep searching ways to get to B &amp; I quadrant. May God bless you with success!</p>
