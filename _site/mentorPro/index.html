      <p>Have you ever been taught concepts of money? Are you struggling with money? Are you worrying about getting a good job? Have you even thought about when you are going to retire if you have a really good job? What about if you were sick and cannot work? After all, the essential point is <b>how you earn, keep, and use your money</b>. I’m glad you are here today and you may be glad you are here too after reading the following important message for you!</p>

<p>What is <b>Financial Freedom</b>? It means your income is greater than your expense. How does it affect your life? It allows you to <b>have a right not to work, spend time with your family, travel, eat good food, and do whatever you love</b>. The most important thing at all is that you’re still earning money while doing the things you love. Unbelievable! <img class="emoji" title=":open_mouth:" alt=":open_mouth:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f62e.png" height="20" width="20"> Incredible! <img class="emoji" title=":scream:" alt=":scream:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f631.png" height="20" width="20"> Yap! I know you may say that because you just knew it. However, it is possible! <img class="emoji" title=":sunglasses:" alt=":sunglasses:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60e.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>A popular Youtuber with millions views can easily made a good amount of passive income through Ads. A skilled business investor can just sit at home and earn passive incomes through multiple businesses. There are many ways to gain passive incomes, such as Stock Markets, Commodities, Real Estates, Patents, Business Ownerships and so on. You can also make passive incomes to achieve YOUR Financial Freedom. You just need a map to success. <i>Have you ever dared to dream? What is your vision and dream for your life? What do you want your life to become? Have you taken any action?</i></p>

<p>I will be 200% honest to show you what I’m doing in this business, why I’m doing it, and the opportunity to help you achieve your dreams and get your Financial Freedom. If you don’t like talking about new idea or business, I would suggest you to close this page so that we don’t offend each other. <b>However, If you desire finanical freedom but don’t know what and how to do, open your heart and mind and take 5~10 minutes to read through this page and ponder about the information. “Sow a thought, reap an act; Sow an act, reap a habit; Sow a habit, reap a character; Sow a character, reap an eternal destiny”</b> - Spencer W. Kimball. Hope this may change your perspective of money, life, and even destiny! <img class="emoji" title=":heart:" alt=":heart:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2764.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The business I’m affiliated with is E.D.G.e Mentorship program and it’s power by <a href="https://www.amway.com/about-amway/yagergroup">The Yager Group</a>. The Yager Group is an independent Amway approved training provider. Their mentoring and training system has established a proven history of helping indivitual build their own successful business. The Yagers Group’s passion has always been to help people who want to help themselves in a business of their own. By helping people develop a good self-image and a strong self-confidence, the Yager Group has inspired tens of thousands to unleash their full potential.</p>

<p>Amway Global is the number-one direct selling business on the planet, raking in around $9 billion a year. Harvard Business School, which described Amway as “one of the most profitable direct selling companies in the world”. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway">Amway Wiki</a>]</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>I know introduction may not touch your heart, same result as I share with most people. Do you know why? It’s because you have not known about it. It’s because it’s easier to reject than to learn. It’s because a new idea clashing with the way they think. “Direct Selling is bad.” “That system does not work.” “It’s impossible to earn that much money.” “That causes money and time.” “[Silence with embarrassing smile…]” Some argue instead of asking questions. Some never ask questions. Then I have questions. <i>“How do you know it doesn’t work?” “Have you done any research or tried it by yourself?” “Or are you allowing other people’s thoughts to block your way to a new better life level?”</i> <b>I am always shocked at people who search changes in their lives, but keep doing same things expecting different outcomes and never invest in their greatest asset, their mind. A truly intelligent person welcomes, listens, and talks about new ideas in order to grasp opportunities to achieve his/her goals and dreams.</b></p>

<p>Have you read one of my favorite books, <b>Rich Dad Poor Dad</b> by Robert Kiyosaki, which improves my Financial IQ and changes my whole perspective of money? If not, <b>I sincerely encourage you to read this book</b>. It will change the way you think, and maybe change your whole life! If you have, AWESOME! You may know how important the knowledge I’m going to share with you! <img class="emoji" title=":thumbsup:" alt=":thumbsup:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>Most people, after age 18, apply jobs and go to work for incomes. When they run out of money, they work harder in order to solve money problems. <i>Have you ever thought about what is wrong with it? Why should you do it in that way? If you get sick or for some reasons that you cannot work, how do you make money? Is there another way that maybe eaiser, or at least you can have choices to do what you like or love and have freedom?</i> <b>The Rich Dad called it “The Rat Race”, which keeps people inside this trap, work more and harder, and pay more taxes because they are lack of knowledge since no one taught them financial education, even schools.</b> <img class="emoji" title=":disappointed_relieved:" alt=":disappointed_relieved:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f625.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h3 id="cash-flow-quadrant">Cash Flow Quadrant</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/amwayFF/cash-flow-quadrant.jpg" alt="cash-flow-quadrant">
E is what most people are doing and where we all start from. Some professional jobs, like lawyers or doctors, are S who earn higher incomes. Do you know what? Their net income are not neccessariy higher than yours for they’re paying more liabilities and taxes. They are still in the Rat Race.</p>

<p>On the other side, people in the B &amp; I quadrant know how to play the game. They invest on assets instead of liabilities in order to gain passive income. <b>B &amp; I are the places giving them time, money, and financial freedom. The poor and the middle class work for money; the rich have money work for them.</b> These are just few concepts I share from “Rich Dad Poor Dad”. Are you interested now? <img class="emoji" title=":smirk:" alt=":smirk:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60f.png" height="20" width="20"> <img class="emoji" title=":grin:" alt=":grin:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f601.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p><b>The more people I get to know, the more disapointment I have since they have not been taught any solid financial knowledge. There are so many people struggling with money. They don’t know what problems they got and how to do with those problems.</b> How sad is that!? <img class="emoji" title=":sob:" alt=":sob:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f62d.png" height="20" width="20"> If you know me well, you may know I’m a person with a lot of love, sincerity, righteousness, passion about serving and helping people. <b>Knowledge is power if knowing how to use.</b> I’m even planning to have a education business in the future in order to make people’s lives better and change the world. And that’s why I typed so much more on WHY and want to help as many people as I can to gain happiness and peace through success! They just don’t have a map to success…</p>

<p><b>Do you know why 90% of new businesses fail? It’s because of </b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Time</li>
  <li>Money</li>
  <li>Knowledge/Skills</li>
  <li>Risk.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>We provide a map to success that cut down those risks for you and have an opportunity for you to become Individual Business Owner earning passive income. Amount of passive income depends on how serious you are and how hard you are willing to learn and grow.</b> I know you’re selecting if this is a right business for you. I’m selecting who is going to be my partner as well. It’s a team game and we make money together as a super team! Of course, it’s hard. I’m doing it and I know it. However, I also know it’s possible because I’m starting to see results.</p>

<p>Now the opportunity is in front of you and you decide it. If you desire to join, <b>you will be required to learn a lot, changing your mindset, ways you think and habits, in order to become stronger in mind and spirit to achieve success. You reap what you sow. You become what you do.</b> I would love to talk to you first and see what I can help for you to prepare yourself for this business and see if you fit this business or not. It is not just about money but also learning and growing; If you are not interested, that’s ok. Maybe it doesn’t fit you. <b>I encourage you to share these important knowledge with your family and friends and keep searching ways to get to B &amp; I quadrant. May God bless you with success!</b> <img class="emoji" title=":innocent:" alt=":innocent:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f607.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
