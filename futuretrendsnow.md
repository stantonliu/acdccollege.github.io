Do you know what is <b>Financial Freedom</b>? It means your income is greater than your expense. How does it affect your life? It basically means you <b>have a right not to work, spend time with your family, travel, eat good food, and do whatever you love</b>. The most important thing is that you still earn money while doing those things. Sounds unbelievable!? Ya~I know you may say that because you just knew it. However, it is possible. 

A popular Youtuber with millions views can easily made a good amount of passive income through Ads. A skilled business investor can just sit at home and earn passive incomes through multiple businesses. There are many ways to gain passive incomes, such as stock markets, commodities, real estates, business system and so on. You can also make passive incomes to achieve YOUR Financial Freedom. You just need a map to success. <b>What is your vision and dream for your life? What do you want your life to become? Have you ever dreamed about that and taken actions? If those are things you desird as I mentioned above, take 5~10 minutes to read through this page.</b> I will show you what I'm doing in this business, why I'm doing it, and what opportunity I get for you that may be one of ways to gain passive income.

## Why

I know introduction may not touch your heart, same result as I share with most people. Do you know why? It's because you have not known about it. It's because it's easier to reject than to learn. It's because a new idea clashing with the way they think. "Direct Selling is bad." "That system does not work." "It's impossible to earn that much money." "That causes money and time." "[Silence with embarrassing smile...]" Some argue instead of asking questions. Some never ask questions. Then I have questions. "How do you know it doesn't work?" "Have you done your own research or tried it by yourself?" "Or are you allowing other people's thoughts to block your way to a new life level?" <b>I am always shocked at people who search changes in their lives, but keep doing same things expecting different outcomes and never invest in their greatest asset, their mind. A truly intelligent person welcomes, listens, and talks about new ideas in order to grasp opportunities to achieve his/her goals and dreams.</b>

Have you read one of my favorite books, <b>Rich Dad Poor Dad</b> by Robert Kiyosaki, which improves my Financial IQ and changes my whole perspective of money? If not, I sincerely encourage you to read it. It will change the way you think, and maybe change your whole life and your family! If you have, AWESOME! You may know how important the knowledge I'm going to share with you today!

Most people, after age 18, apply jobs and go to work for incomes. When they run out of money, they work harder in order to solve money problems. Have you ever thought about what is wrong with it? Why should you do it in that way? If you get sick or for some reasons that you cannot work, how do you make money? Is there another way that maybe eaiser, or at least you can have choices to do what you like or love and have freedom? <b>The Rich Dad called it "The Rat Race", which keeps people inside this trap, work more and harder, and pay more taxes because they are lack of knowledge since no one taught them financial education, even schools. </b>

#### Cash Flow Quadrant
![cash-flow-quadrant](/assets/futuretrendsnow/cash-flow-quadrant.jpg)
E is what most people are doing and where we all start from. Some professional jobs, like lawyers or doctors, are S who earn higher incomes. Do you know what? Their net income are not neccessariy higher than yours for they're paying more liabilities and taxes. They are still in the Rat Race. 

On the other side, people in the B & I quadrant know how to play the game. They invest on assets instead of liabilities in order to gain passive income. B & I are the places giving them time, money, and financial freedom. The poor and the middle class work for money; the rich have money work for them. These are just few concepts I share from "Rich Dad Poor Dad". Are you interested now? Go read it and change your life!

The more people I get to know, the more disapointment I have since they have not been taught any solid financial knowledge. There are so many people struggling with money. They don't know what problems they got and how to do with those problems. How sad is that!? If you know me well, you may know I'm a person with a lot of love, sincerity, righteousness, passion about serving and helping people. <b>Knowledge is power if knowing how to use.</b> I'm even planning to have a education business in the future in order to make people's lives better and change the world. And that's why I typed so much more on WHY and be here to help you because each individual person is important! They just don't have a map to success...
